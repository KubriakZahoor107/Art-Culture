# Art & Culture Backend

This repository contains an Express API server that uses Prisma for database access. The codebase targets **Node.js 20**.
Portions of the backend are gradually being migrated to **TypeScript** for improved type safety.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix server
   # if you encounter peer dependency warnings
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps --prefix server
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder based on `server/.env.sample` and set all required environment variables.
3. Generate the Prisma client and apply migrations if needed:
   ```bash
   npx --prefix server prisma generate
   npx --prefix server prisma migrate deploy
   ```
4. The TypeScript configuration used by the API lives in `server/tsconfig.json`.
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --prefix server
   ```

## Tests and Linting

Dev dependencies such as Jest and ESLint are installed with `npm install` in the `server` directory. ESLint now uses the flat configuration file `eslint.config.js` at the project root. Tests live under `server/tests` and must be executed from that folder.

```bash
npm run lint --prefix server
npm test --prefix server
```

Both commands require the dependencies to be installed locally inside `server`.

## File Uploads

Uploaded files are stored under `server/uploads/` which is ignored by Git.

## Logging

The backend uses **Winston** for centralized logging. Errors are captured by a
dedicated middleware that returns a consistent JSON structure and writes details
to the logger.

## Environment

The example environment file `server/.env.sample` lists all variables required to run the server. Create your own `.env` with database credentials, JWT secrets and mail settings before starting the server.
